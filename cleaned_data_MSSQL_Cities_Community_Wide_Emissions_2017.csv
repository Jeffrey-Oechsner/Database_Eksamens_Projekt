Individual uncertainty levels for emission factors and most other parameters have been applied with reference to either Lithuania‚Äôs NIR or IPCC recommendations. Uncertainty of activity levels has been evaluated based on expert judgement and in most cases it coincides with that evaluated in Lithuania‚Äôs NIR.The combined uncertainty level of the inventory (12.7 %) is close to that of Lithuania‚Äôs NIR (11.5 % excluding LULUCF) and may be considered acceptable. It is recommended to evaluate trend uncertainty with further emission inventories. As Road Transportation category emissions yielded high uncertainty levels it is recommended to address this issue in the future inventories and develop more transparent and comprehensive methodologies for evaluation of activity levels."
